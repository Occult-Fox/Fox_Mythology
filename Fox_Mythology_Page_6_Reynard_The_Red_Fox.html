    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>This page will examine the folklore figure of Reynard the Red Fox, a European trickster character who first appeared in the 12th century. The stories in which he features were often used to satirize society, morality, and power, while also highlighting his rivalries with other animals. Reynard's tales became especially popular across the regions of the Low Countries, France, Germany, and England, where they were widely circulated and adapted.</p>
    <h3>Reynard</h3>

    <p>Reynard is characterized as a self-serving figure whose amorality and cunning often make him both hero and villain within the tales he inhabits. Audiences, however, are able to sympathize with his struggles, as he consistently overcomes brute force through quick wit and intellect. When read as satire, these stories function as critiques of hypocrisy and corruption within medieval institutions such as the courts, the church, and the nobility. Reynard's moral ambiguity, his lies and manipulative strategies, illuminates the gray areas of survival and justice. He frequently finds himself on trial, yet through sly rhetoric and clever subversion, he manages to turn these cases to his advantage.</p>

    <h3>Stories</h3>
    <p>The stories featuring Reynard often begin with him being accused of crimes ranging from theft to even murder. These accusations bring him before the court, where he faces charges that may be exaggerated or truthful but are reframed to ensure a guilty verdict. However, Reynard consistently uses his wit and storytelling skills to twist the accusations in his favor. To escape punishment, he employs various tricks—such as feigning repentance or inventing elaborate distractions that send the court on wild goose chases. While these schemes allow him to avoid immediate consequences, his victories are never permanent, as his mischievous nature inevitably leads to further charges.</p>
    <h3>Disney's Robin Hood</h3>

    <p>Many viewers of Disney's Robin Hood have wondered why the characters in the film are anthropomorphic animals and why Robin Hood himself is portrayed as a fox. The simple answer is that the film was originally intended to be an adaptation of the medieval trickster Reynard the Fox. Following the success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937, Walt Disney considered creating an animated version of Reynard's tales. However, the darker themes of the stories, particularly adultery and murder, were deemed unsuitable for family audiences, and the project was shelved until 1968. At that time, animator Ken Anderson revived the idea by shifting the focus to Robin Hood while retaining the anthropomorphic animal characters, making the narrative more palatable for families. Even with this change in character and storyline, elements of Reynard remain visible in Robin Hood: he employs similar tricks to those found in Reynard's tales and often displays the fox's signature sly smile throughout the film.</p>
