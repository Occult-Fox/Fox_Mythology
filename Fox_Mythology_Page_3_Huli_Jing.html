    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>The mythology of red foxes across the Asian region generally follows a similar template of powers and behaviors, even though some traditions differ significantly from what is considered the baseline. These mythological foxes share many characteristics because they all trace their origins back to Chinese folklore, which spread throughout the region via trade and migration. Over time, each culture that adopted these fox spirits added its own unique twist, creating distinct local interpretations while preserving the shared core elements.</p>
    <p>Among the traits that remain consistent are their ability to shapeshift into human form, most commonly into an attractive woman, and their frequent portrayal as seducers, since many of their stories revolve around themes of temptation, romance, and deception. Another widely shared feature is their increasing power with age: fox spirits are said to gain an additional tail every century they live, ultimately culminating in the iconic nine-tailed form. This final stage is so distinctive that these beings are often referred to simply as Nine-Tailed Foxes. They are also typically depicted as morally ambiguous, rarely fitting neatly into categories of purely good or purely evil.</p>
    <h3>The Huil Jing of China - The Original</h3>

    <p>Huli Jing (hoo-lee jing), which translates to "fox spirit", is the origin point for all later mythological fox beings in East Asia. According to tradition, a normal fox becomes a huli jing only if it manages to live for an unusually long time, typically around fifty years, at which point it begins to develop magical abilities. By the age of one hundred, it gains the power to shapeshift, and it continues to grow stronger every century. After one thousand years, it reaches its ultimate form as a Nine-Tailed Fox, the pinnacle of fox-spirit power.</p>

    <p>Unlike some later regional variations, huli jing are not inherently good or evil. They can be helpful allies to the protagonists of their stories, or they can be dangerous, vindictive beings depending on their motives and the situation. They also share the seductive nature seen in other fox-spirit traditions. This behavior may stem from their ability to consume a partner's life force through intimate encounters, sometimes lethally, or from emotional reasons such as love, longing, or companionship.</p>
    <p>There is also a distinct subgroup of fox spirits known as Huxian (hoo-shee-an), meaning "Fox Immortal". Unlike huli jing, Huxian are not considered mere spirits but rather deities or deity-adjacent beings. They are worshipped as gods of wealth, protection, fortune, and fertility, especially in northern China, where they are regarded as some of the most powerful local deities. Despite their divine status, they still display many of the characteristic behaviors associated with fox spirits.</p>
    <h3>Daji - The Most Evil Fox Spirit</h3>
<div class="Paragraph">
    <img src="Daji.png" alt="A depiction of Daji being confronted" class="float-img">
    <p>The Huli Jing appear throughout Chinese folklore, but one of the most notable and infamous among them is Daji, who is also considered one of the most influential mythological fox spirits in East Asian tradition. Historically, Daji was a real woman from the Su clan, and she became the most favored concubine of King Zhou of Shang, the final ruler of the Shang dynasty.</p>
</div>
    <p>As people sought explanations for the fall of the Shang dynasty, later generations began attributing supernatural qualities to Daji. Over time, it became widely believed that she was actually a Nine-Tailed Fox who had killed the real Daji and taken her form in order to punish the king for his immorality, ultimately driving him toward tyranny. She was said to have ordered executions for her own amusement, manipulated court politics to eliminate rivals, encouraged the king's descent into cruelty, and even invented the infamous Bronze Toaster torture device, a massive bronze cylinder filled with flammable materials in which victims were burned alive.</p>
    <p>Daji's most famous appearance is in the classic novel Fengshen Yanyi (Investiture of the Gods), which cemented her status as one of the most evil villains in Chinese literature. Her portrayal as a Huli Jing shaped the broader image of fox spirits across East Asia: seductive, dangerous, politically disruptive, and capable of immense supernatural influence. Without the characterisation of Daji, the mythology of fox spirits throughout Asia would likely look very different today.</p>
