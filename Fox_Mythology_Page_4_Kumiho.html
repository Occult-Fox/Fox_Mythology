    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>The mythology of red foxes across the Asian region generally follows a similar template of powers and behaviors, even though some traditions differ significantly from what is considered the baseline. These mythological foxes share many characteristics because they all trace their origins back to Chinese folklore, which spread throughout the region via trade and migration. Over time, each culture that adopted these fox spirits added its own unique twist, creating distinct local interpretations while preserving the shared core elements.</p>
    <p>Among the traits that remain consistent are their ability to shapeshift into human form, most commonly into an attractive woman, and their frequent portrayal as seducers, since many of their stories revolve around themes of temptation, romance, and deception. Another widely shared feature is their increasing power with age: fox spirits are said to gain an additional tail every century they live, ultimately culminating in the iconic nine-tailed form. This final stage is so distinctive that these beings are often referred to simply as Nine-Tailed Foxes. They are also typically depicted as morally ambiguous, rarely fitting neatly into categories of purely good or purely evil.</p>
    <h3>The Kumiho / Gumiho of Korea - The Vindictive Sadists</h3>

    <p>The Kumiho (pronounced koo-mi-ho or goo-mee-ho), meaning Nine-Tailed Fox, is the Korean iteration of the Asian fox spirit. While it shares some core traits with its counterparts, such as shapeshifting and seductive allure, the similarities largely end there. Unlike the often mischievous or morally ambiguous fox spirits of China and Japan, the Kumiho is depicted as maliciously predatory toward humans. It uses cunning, seduction, and illusion to lure victims within reach or isolate them, ultimately seeking to kill and consume their flesh, with a particular emphasis on devouring the heart or liver, believed to sustain its supernatural existence.</p>
</div>
    <p>Overall, the Kumiho's behavior is comparable to that of a sociopath. It rarely feels genuine care for humans, and any affection it displays is typically a facade meant to manipulate. Sadism is another defining trait: Kumihos are said to relish the suffering they cause, prolonging torment when possible, toying with emotions, and heightening terror before the kill. They are also depicted as vindictive, holding grudges against those who expose their deceptions or thwart their hunts. Once slighted, a Kumiho may pursue vengeance with relentless patience, seeking to inflict the maximum suffering on its enemy.</p>
    <p>The powers of the Kumiho resemble those of other fox spirits, but with notable flaws. Its shapeshifting is imperfect, often leaving traces of its true nature, such as tails, ears, or other fox-like features, which it attempts to conceal. It can also mimic voices, further enhancing its deception. Some legends claim that if a Kumiho abstains from killing for 1,000 days (or years, depending on the tale), it may transform into a human. Yet, given its predatory and sadistic personality, most stories suggest that Kumihos are unlikely to pursue such redemption.</p>
    <h3>Art</h3>
    <p>Notably, while there are many descriptions of the Kumiho in traditional stories, there are no surviving traditional artworks depicting them. It was believed that painting a Kumiho would amount to visually celebrating the creature, an act thought to bring misfortune upon the artist. As a result, any images of the Kumiho that exist today were created in the 20th century or later.</p>
